DEV BACKLOG:

1. Only show lines that are visible in single image view
2. show proper numbers
3. provide grade for each line, and express count - in this priority
4. figure out how to provide a full region - maybe sokoliki ?
5. maybe merge more than one result and return more than one homeography matrix if users image overlaps more than one topo

OPERATIONS BACKLOG:

1. do topo of some region and verify it myself. Possibly at the spot take own photos, maybe with a DRON
